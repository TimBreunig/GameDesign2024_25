# Loft Raider


## How to play

Loft Raider is a 2D-platformer, but instead of going left and right, you're making your way upwards to the roof!
Dodge the flower pots being thrown down from the building to not lose health.
In case you've already taken damage, collect the hearts to regain health points.
If you run out of health or time on your way up, you will get caught by the police and fail the level.

The first time you will play level 1, a short intro cutscene will appear to introduce you to the game's theme.
